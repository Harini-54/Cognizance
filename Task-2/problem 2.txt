2) Write pseudocode and flowchart for program that prints Nth fibonacci number. (Nth Fibonacci Number denoted as F(N), F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2,â€¦)

Pseudo code:

#This program will allow the user to find the nth term of a fibonacci number series
Declare the variables currentterm,nextterm,previousterm,Nth term,i as integer
Ask the user to enter which term they want
Store the number as Nthterm
Initialize the terms: previousterm=0,currentterm=1
For i=1 to Nthterm
assign  nextterm=currentterm+previousterm
	previousterm=currentterm
	currentterm=nextterm
when this loop is done, 
Give the previousterm as output.
With this the user can get the Nth term of fibonacci series.
