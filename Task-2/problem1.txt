1) Write pseudocode and flowchart for a program that outputs ‘True’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘False’ otherwise, without using the ‘%’ operator explicitly (like N % 3 == 0).
NOTE: You can use ‘%’ operator to separate each digit of the given number(like N % 10).

Pseudo code:

 # This program will allow the user to find whether a number is divisible by 3 or not by not using "%" operator 
Declare variables a,sum1,rem1, rem,sum,x
Get  number i.e x (# enter the number for which you want to check whether the number is Divisible by 3 or not )
Initialize sum=0
while a>0 
          assign that rem= a%10 (#% means co eficent when numerator was divided by denominator)
         assign that  sum=sum+rem
         assign that  a=a/10
if 
   sum==0 or sum==3 or sum==6 or sum==9 
   print "True"
else if 
         sum1<=9 
         print " True"
else 
      assign that   x=sum
      assign that sum1=0
while 
       assign that rem1=x%10
       assign  that sum1 = sum1+rem1
       assign that  x=x/10
if 
      sum1==0 or sum1==3 or sum1==6 or sum1==9 
        print "True"
else 
         print "False"
