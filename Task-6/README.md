## Theme:- 

* The Theme is Music 
* We provide you with more than 90 million songs.
* You can buy our premium to seamless and add-less music.


## Motive:-

>--- Million of songs in your pocket ---

* We had the idea of providing people with a variety of music options for free, allowing them to create and enjoy seamless music and create their own playlists without paying for premium.


## Future Improvements:-

* We're going to offer a function that will allow you to make your own song or music.
* We are going to make it so that you may collaborate with your friends or others to form your own band to compose music.
* We are going to provide you with a better user interface.
